## Course Description and Objectives ##

Internet mapping technologies are an important component of geospatial data capture, sharing, visualization, and delivery. This course provides a survey of current and emerging internet and geospatial interoperability standards, technologies, and capabilities. The emphasis of the work in this class will be hands-on experience in four critical aspects of Internet-enabled mapping:

* The basic concepts behind web development and web mapping technologies that enable the delivery of maps and mapped data through web browsers

* The Open Standards that facilitate the exchange of map images and geospatial data over the internet

* The use of published standards-based services in desktop mapping applications that implement those standards

* The deployment of standards-based geospatial map and data services that other systems and users may make use of

The specific class objectives that relate to these activities and departmental learning outcomes for [undergraduate](http://geography.unm.edu/academics/Undergraduate%20Program/under_outcome.html) and [graduate students](http://geography.unm.edu/academics/Graduate%20Program/learning-outcome.html) in the Geography & Environmental Studies Department include the following:

* Students will understand the concepts geospatial data and service interoperability

* Students will be able to define the specific requirements of a particular analysis or project and identify the interoperability standards that are capable of meeting those requirements

* Students will be knowledgeable in the core technologies that they may use to produce their own internet-enabled mapping capabilities 

* Students will understand the strengths and limitations of current internet mapping technologies for generating cartographically effective map products. 


## Course Format ##

The class is structured around a combination of readings; video tutorials, lectures and demonstration; in-class demonstrations; and in-class lab work in which students will have an opportunity to work on their milestone and deep-dive assignments and work on collaborative problem solving around those assignments. 

The class will consist of the following components:

Lectures/Video Tutorials 
~	Recorded presentations that provides an overview of high-level concepts, technical demonstrations and reference information

Portfolio Milestones (weekly)
~	Hands-on experiences with the technologies and capabilities covered in the course. The milestones will be exploratory, in that in many instances the work will be problem based with an emphasis on creative use of concepts and reference materials in answering questions and solving practical problems.

Deep Dives (4 over the course of the semester)
~	Activities based upon small projects that reinforce the hands-on activities undertaken in the milestones. 

Peer Review of Developing Portfolio
~	Provision of substantive feedback and discussion around products generated by peers in the class. 

Mid-term & Final Examinations
~	Take-home examinations that cover materials introduced in class. 

Readings
~	Background and reference materials that should be reviewed in conjunction with each week's materials. 


## Course Readings and Other Materials##

Readings for the class are derived from a combination of designated course texts (available in digital form through the library) and online resources. While the specific readings for each week will be provided as part of the information about each class module, they will fall into two broad categories:

Required
~	Readings that cover core knowledge required for success in the course's activities.

Reference
~	Readings that should be reviewed so that they may be effectively used as reference materials when working on lab and homework assignments and exams. These materials typically include specific syntax for web development and other information that you are not expected to memorize but instead know how to find and use when working on a particular problem.

There are three texts that are being used in the course as core resources and are therefore listed as *required* texts.

Duckett, Jon, and Larsen, Rob. *Beginning HTML and CSS*. Somerset, NJ, USA: John Wiley & Sons, 2013. ProQuest ebrary. Web. 28 December 2015. This book is available online through the [University Library](http://site.ebrary.com.libproxy.unm.edu/lib/unma/detail.action?docID=10667426) (you will be asked to login using your UNM NetID and password to access this book if accessing it from off campus)

Svennerberg, Gabriel. *Beginning Google Maps API 3*. Apress, © 2010. Books24x7. Web. Dec. 28, 2015. AKA *Google Maps API* in reading assignments. Available through the [*Books 24x7 Library Database*](http://library.books24x7.com.libproxy.unm.edu/toc.aspx?bookid=36390&refid=SVA3S). You will need to create a login for Books 24x7 to access this for the first time. After that you can login using the username and password you created from on- or off-campus. 

Gratier, T., Spencer, P., & Hazzard, E. (2015). *Openlayers 3 beginner's guide : Get started with openlayers 3 and enhance your web pages by creating and displaying dynamic maps*. Birmingham, England: Packt Publishing.  AKA *OpenLayers Beginner's Guide* in reading assignments. Available as an ebook through the [University Libraries](https://unm-on-worldcat-org.libproxy.unm.edu/oclc/903963849?databaseList=1271,143,1487,1533,1540,1672,1708,173,1925,2006,2007,203,2201,2237,2259,2260,2261,2262,2263,2264,2267,2268,2281,2328,3036,3201,638). 

In addition to the reading materials for the course, some course content is also provided through a selection of Lynda.com tutorials. Access to Lynda.com is free to all UNM students and the tutorials that will be used in the class can be found in an online playlist created for the course. The playlist can be found [here](http://www.lynda.com/SharedPlaylist/2b710369c9ec4d8c964467225c6610ad?org=unm.edu). In some cases specific sections of the tutorials that are not relevant to the course have been excluded from the playlist. 


## Evaluation and Grading ##

Class grades will be based upon the number of points acquired throughout the semester. The grade breakdown will be as follows:

A
~	360 - 400 points

B
~	320 - 359.9 points

C
~	280 - 319.9 points

D
~	240 - 279.9 points

F
~	< 240 points

Points for the class will be earned through a combination of portfolio milestones, deep dives, peer-review, and exams.
 
As an ongoing exercise in working with the web-based technologies upon which the course is based, all milestone and deep dive activities *(after the first week's exercise)* will be completed as individual web pages within your web portfolio developed in the class. 

You will use locally hosted [LoboGit](http://lobogit.unm.edu) platform for developing and sharing your portfolio with the instructor and the other students in the class. Optionally, you can use GitHub [https://github.com](https://github.com) to publicly share your web content. We will review the process for using LoboGit and setting up your GitHub account during the first class session.  
 
Portfolio Milestones
~	There will be 13 weekly milestones. While there are no formal weekly due dates for the milestones, you *must keep up* if you expect to successfully complete the course. *If you fall behind it will be very difficult to catch up*. I will evaluate your portfolio milestones at mid-term (40 points) and at the end of the term (40 points) for completeness, functionality, creativity and accuracy (i.e. correct answers for milestone questions when asked). 

Deep Dives
~	There will be 4 deep dive assignments during the semester. These will be small project-focussed activities that will be added to your portfolio and will reinforce the hands-on activities undertaken as part of the portfolio milestones. Each homework assignment will be worth an additional 25 points (100 points total). Evaluation of the deep dive assignments will also take place at mid-term and at the end of the class as part of the portfolio review. 

Peer Review
~	There will be 4 points during the semester that you will be asked to perform a peer review of specific components within the portfolios of your peers. Each peer review will contribute up to 5-points to your overall score for the course. The peer-review points you earn will be based upon the *substantive* feedback that you provide to other students as part of the assignment. I will review the peer-review procedures in more detail when we have our first peer-review activity. 

Exams 
~	There will be two exams: a midterm and final. The midterm will be a take-home exam that will be released on Monday March 7 and due on Friday March 11 at 5:00 pm. The final exam will be a take-home exam which will released on Monday May 9 and due on Wednesday May 11 by 5:00 pm. Each exam will be worth 100 points (200 points total). 

While students are encouraged to collaborate in their work on their portfolio milestone and deep dive assignments, submitted work must be original and written and submitted by each individual student. Both exams will be individual - each student must complete their exam individually. All assignments and exams are open book and online resources may also be used in completion of the assignments and exams. BUT, again, all submitted work must be original and created by each student.
