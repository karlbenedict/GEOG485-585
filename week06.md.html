<h1 id="week06">Week 6 - Module 4.1 - Interoperability Standards - XML, KML, and WMS</h1>
<p>This week's class focuses on three open interoperability standards that are the most broadly used of the standards that we will be covering.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Extensible Markup Language (XML)</dt>
<dd><p>The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) standard that is the foundation for many other service and data standards including: the service metadata (GetCapabilities) for the OGC WMS, WFS, and WCS, Geography Markup Language (GML), and KML.</p>
</dd>
<dt>KML</dt>
<dd><p>Formerly known as Keyhole Markup Language, an OGC standard since 2008, KML is a combined geospatial data and representation standard that enables the combined transfer of both location-based data and styling information within a defined XML model.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Web Map Service (WMS)</dt>
<dd><p>The OGC standard for providing on-demand map visualizations based upon user provided parameters reflecting selected data layers, defined areas of interest, image formats, and optionally time of interest.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p><em>Expected Outcomes</em></p>
<p>At the end of this class students should have an understanding of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The basic characteristics of XML documents, including the concepts of <em>well-formed</em> and <em>valid</em> XML</p></li>
<li><p>The capabilities of KML for providing both data and representation information for geospatially referenced data.</p></li>
<li><p>The request-response model for OGC WMS, including the required and optional request parameters for the <em>GetCapabilities</em>, <em>GetMap</em>, and <em>GetFeatureInfo</em> requests; and the response types generated in response to those requests.</p></li>
<li><p>A general familiarity with the linkage between the WMS and KML standards</p></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Key Concepts</em></p>
<ul>
<li><p>XML as a general standard for structured data exchange, with DTDs and Schemas defining application specific data models</p></li>
<li><p>KML as a data and representation standard for delivery of geospatial data and symbolization information into client applications, both desktop and web-based.</p></li>
<li><p>WMS as a geospatial data visualization standard for providing online access to map images in a variety of formats for integration into desktop and web-based mapping applications</p></li>

<h2 id="week06-milestone">Weekly Milestone - WMS &amp; KML</h2>
<p>There are a large number of WMS services available on the web. One way to find interesting services is to search for them using standard search engines such as Google. Try searching for the following search phrase:</p>
<p><code>“REQUEST=GetCapabilities” and “SERVICE=WMS”</code></p>
<p>as a single search phrase</p>
<dl>
<dt>Question 1</dt>
<dd>What search engine did you use?
</dd>
<dt>Question 2</dt>
<dd>How many ‘hits’ did you get?
</dd>
<dt>Question 3</dt>
<dd>How useful (generally in terms of getting a pointers to live WMS services [defined as a <em>functioning</em> GetCapabilities request]) were the ‘hits’?
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Pick two of the services that included live &quot;GetCapabilities&quot; requests that you found above, and answer the following questions about each.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Question 4 (service #1)</dt>
<dd><p>What is the URL for the full GetCapabilities request to the service?</p>
<p>What is the Name of the service?</p>
<p>What Format(s) are available for GetMap requests from the service?</p>
<p>How many layers are included in the service (<em>including nesting layers</em>)?</p>
</dd>
<dt>Question 4 (service #2)</dt>
<dd><p>What is the URL for the full GetCapabilities request to the service?</p>
<p>What is the Name of the service?</p>
<p>What Format(s) are available for GetMap requests from the service?</p>
<p>How many layers are included in the service (<em>including nesting layers</em>)?</p>
</dd>
<dt>Question 5: For one of the layers in the first service,</dt>
<dd><p>What is the name of the layer?</p>
<p>What is the SRS of the layer?</p>
<p>What is the name of the projection that matches the SRS EPSG code?</p>
<p>What is the LatLonBoundingBox of the layer?</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Open the following GetCapabilities request in your browser. Select “View Source” from the browser menu to see the delivered XML document (it may appear as an unformatted string of text by default in your browser - if that is the case, save the file to your hard drive and view it in a text editor). Use the information in the XML capabilities document to formulate <code>GetMap</code> requests for the following map images. Include the requests and resulting images in your write-up. Comment on anything unusual that you notice in the images that are returned.</p>
